								</header>
								<p>
									Graduated in Information Engineering in 2018 from the University of Padua (Italy)
									and in Artificial Intelligence with a specialization in Computational Intelligence
									and Robotics in 2021 from the University of Groningen (Netherlands), I am an engineer
									with experience in a wide variety of subjects.

									<h2>Software</h2>
								</header>
									<p>
										Both in the academical environment and for my personal growth I engaged myself in
										numerous projects to make experience and learn. Here are a few examples:
									</p>
								<section>
									<h3><a href="https://github.com/tparisotto/more_fyp">Simultaneous 3D Object Recognition and Pose Estimation System</a></h3>
									<p>
										The objective of the project is to infer the class and the pose of an object,
										starting from its point cloud representation in the 3D space.
										The approach is to use a Multi-View Convolutional Neural Network to identify
										the object. While previous approaches used a fixed number of orthogonal projections
										of the object to identify, we hypotesized a flexible amount of those point of views
										would be decrease the computation time required, specially when the object's projections
										carry a lot of redundant information.

									<h3><a href="https://github.com/tparisotto/mlproj20_kmnist">Handwritten Hiragana Characters Recognition</a></h3>
									<p>
										To test a wide array of Machine Learning techniques we used the Kuzushiji-MNIST
										dataset as a playground. KMNIST is a handwritten characters dataset similar to MNIST,
										however the character in KMNIST are Japanese characters from the Hiragana alphabet.
										The project consisted in the development, testing and evaluation of different Machine Learning
										and Deep Learning techniques, starting from very simple algorithms to more complex
										ensembles of classifiers and Neural Networks. A lot of focus was put on Data Augmentation
										and Image Processing, and their impact on the models' performance.
